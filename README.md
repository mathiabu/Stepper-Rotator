# Stepper-Rotator
Rotation machine for recirculating Organ-on-Chip systems. There are currently 2 versions of the machine: (A) with manual tilt adjustment and (B) with servo-motor controlled tilt adjust.

Mounting instructions:

1. Laser-cut DXF files into acrylic. Use following thickness for the different parts:
  Back, Front, Bottom and Side: 5 mm, Top: 1.5 mm, Adapter: 6 mm.
  For version (A) use 2x Adapter-left and 2xSide-A. Delete the text and angle scale in Side-A and engrave this in the second step.
  For version (B) use Adapter-left + Adapter-right and Side-B-left + Side-B-right
2. Some of the files contains engravemt (Side-B right, Side-A, Back). You have to align the engravement with the cutted parts and create and overlay to only remove the difference in the software of your lasercutter. For both versions this is a Hex-nut for the power connector. In version A engrave only the scale for the tilt. If you want it on both sides, mirrow it. For version B, engrave rectengular structure on side-B-right to fix the servomotor. All engravements should be 1-2 mm deep.
3. 3D-print the stl files
